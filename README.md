# Summer_Intern_2024_IvLabs
Worked as a Summer Intern at IvLabs, VNIT on a Project dealing with implementing the research paper on FSRCNN and SRCNN. 
The Project involved learning core concepts of ML , ANNs and CNNs. 
I have implemented a Handwrtten Digit Recognition (MNIST dataset) model from scratch using numpy , as well as using a CNN architecture in PyTorch , as a part of the learning process. 
I have also implemented a Object Classification (CIFAR-10 dataset) model using a CNN architecture.
